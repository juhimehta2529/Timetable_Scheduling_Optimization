# Timetable_Scheduling_Optimization
A Python tool that automatically creates optimal university schedules. Handles multiple years, divisions, subjects, professors, and classrooms while avoiding conflicts. Uses evolutionary computation to balance workloads and meet teaching hour requirements. Outputs complete timetables and detailed statistics. 

## Features

- Generates weekly timetables for multiple academic years
- Handles professor availability and workload balancing
- Ensures no classroom or professor double-booking
- Balances subject hours across the week
- Provides detailed statistics on the generated schedule
- Includes both complete and division-wise timetable views

## INPUT DATA CONFIGURATION

This section defines all the scheduling constraints and resources:

1. **YEARS STRUCTURE**:
   - Contains 3 academic years (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
   - Each year has:
     * Divisions: A, B, C, D (4 classes per year)
     * Subjects: 6 subjects per year
     * Professors: 2-3 professors per subject

2. **INFRASTRUCTURE**:
   - Classrooms: 16 rooms available (N201-N208, N301-N308)
   - Time slots: 6 daily slots (9AM-4PM with 1PM-2PM break)
   - Days: Monday to Friday (5-day week)

3. **TEACHING REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Each subject needs 4 hours/week per division
   - Total hours per division: 24 (6 subjects Ã— 4 hours)

You can modify these parameters to match your institution's:
- Academic structure
- Available resources
- Scheduling needs


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- collections (defaultdict)
